Call Centre

A call centre is looking to optimize their operations. This means adopting a new system for recording all it's data.
First, the call centre has employees that are either agents or managers. For the employees we store only minimal information: id and name. Agents also have a seniority (Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3).
The calls themselves have the time they came into the centre, and if it was accepted, then the Agent who handled them.
Calls are coming into the call centre through queues. A queue has a name, a list of calls that are waiting to be answered and the list of agents that are responsible for picking up the calls. There are two types of queues: high priority queues and normal queues. High priority queues can only have Level 3 agents, while normal ones have no rules regarding agents seniority. The queue also exposes what is the call that has been waiting for the longest.
The call centre operator is also interested in finding the queue name that has the most calls waiting.
